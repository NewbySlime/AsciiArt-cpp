# AsciiArt-cpp
Just a little side project that I make after getting inspired by a youtuber. This program name already says itself, making a Ascii Art from an image (and possibly animated ones and videos if I feel like continuing it). If DirectShow still can use user own class, I might already finished the code for videos.

## Inspired by

## Compiling
Use mingw32-make to compile it.

## Supported file formats
For now, just BMP files.

## Bugs that's still makes itself home
 * ~~Escape codes doesn't work for Windows' CMD, I used vscode's powershell.~~ (done)
 * ~~Timing on each frame doesn't match.~~ (done)

## Not complete
 * APNG, alternative of GIF (after I make PNG opener)
 * Videos (I don't know if I will finish this)
